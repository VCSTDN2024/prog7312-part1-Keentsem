- **Constraints**: `where T : IComparable<T>`
- **Features**: Automatic sorting, min/max operations

### 2. Operator Overloading for Issue Class

#### Comparison Operators
- **File**: `Models/Issue.cs`
- **Operators**: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`
- **Implementation**: Based on priority, points, and submission date
- **Usage**: Enables natural comparison of issues

#### Arithmetic Operators
- **Addition Operator (`+`)**: Merges two issues into one
- **Multiplication Operator (`*`)**: Scales issue points by multiplier
- **Usage**: Demonstrates custom arithmetic operations

#### Equality Operators
- **Implementation**: Based on unique issue ID
- **Override**: `Equals()` and `GetHashCode()` methods
- **Usage**: Enables proper collection operations

### 3. Recursive Algorithms

#### Recursive Issue Filtering
- **File**: `Data/IssuesRepository.cs`
- **Methods**:
  - `CountIssuesByCategoryRecursive()`: Count issues by category
  - `FindIssuesByPriorityRecursive()`: Filter issues by priority
  - `CalculateTotalPointsRecursive()`: Calculate total points
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of issues

#### Recursive Data Processing
- **File**: `Services/AdvancedDataStructuresService.cs`
- **Methods**:
  - `CountIssuesRecursively()`: Recursive counting
  - `FilterIssuesRecursively()`: Recursive filtering
  - `CalculateTotalPointsRecursively()`: Recursive accumulation
