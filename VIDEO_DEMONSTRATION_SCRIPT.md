### 2. Event Handlers Implementation (0:15 - 0:45)
**Visual**: Navigate to Report Issues page and demonstrate form submission
**Narration**:
> "Let's start with event handlers. Our application uses multiple types of event handlers for different user interactions."

**Code Demonstration**:
```csharp
// Show the event handler in ReportIssues.cshtml.cs
public async Task<IActionResult> OnPostAsync()
{
    // Event handling for form submission
    var result = await _issueManagementService.SubmitIssueAsync(Issue);
    
    // Event handlers for notifications
    OnIssueSubmitted(new IssueEventArgs(issue));
    OnBadgeEarned(new BadgeEarnedEventArgs(badge, userEmail));
}
```

**Live Demo**:
1. Fill out the issue report form
2. Submit the form
3. Show the success message and points update
4. Demonstrate the notification system

**Key Points**:
- Form submission event handling
- Real-time UI updates
- Notification event system
- Badge earning events

### 3. Multi-Dimensional Arrays (0:45 - 1:15)
**Visual**: Show the code for multi-dimensional array implementation
**Narration**:
> "For user data management, we implemented multi-dimensional arrays to store and track user information efficiently."

**Code Demonstration**:
```csharp
// Show the multi-dimensional array in UserRepository.cs
private static object[,,] _userDataArray = new object[1000, 8, 10];
// Dimensions: [UserIndex, DataField, TimeIndex]
// DataField indices: 0=ID, 1=Username, 2=Email, 3=Points, 4=Level, 5=Reports, 6=Badges, 7=LastActive

// Show array operations
public static void UpdateUserPointsInArray(int userId, int newPoints)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < _currentUserCount; i++)
    {
        if ((int)_userDataArray[i, 0, _currentTimeIndex] == userId)
        {
            _userDataArray[i, 3, _currentTimeIndex] = newPoints;
            _userDataArray[i, 4, _currentTimeIndex] = (int)newLevel;
            _userDataArray[i, 7, _currentTimeIndex] = DateTime.UtcNow;
        }
    }
}
```

**Live Demo**:
1. Show user login
2. Demonstrate points update after issue submission
3. Show how the array tracks user data over time

**Key Points**:
- 3D array structure for user data
- Time-based data snapshots
- Efficient data retrieval and updates
- Memory management with fixed-size arrays

### 4. Advanced Data Structures (1:15 - 1:45)
**Visual**: Show the various data structures used in the application
**Narration**:
> "Our application uses several advanced data structures to manage complex municipal data efficiently."

**Code Demonstration**:
```csharp
// Show ConcurrentDictionary for thread-safe operations
private readonly ConcurrentDictionary<IssueCategory, ConcurrentQueue<Issue>> _categoryQueues;
private readonly ConcurrentDictionary<IssuePriority, ConcurrentBag<Issue>> _priorityBags;
private readonly ConcurrentDictionary<string, List<Issue>> _locationIndex;

// Show multi-dimensional arrays for analytics
private readonly int[,] _categoryPriorityMatrix;
private readonly int[,,] _locationCategoryPriorityMatrix;

// Show ArrayList for non-generic storage
private static readonly ArrayList _users = new ArrayList();
```

**Live Demo**:
1. Show the analytics dashboard
2. Demonstrate how data is organized by category and priority
3. Show the leaderboard with user rankings

**Key Points**:
- Concurrent collections for thread safety
- Multi-dimensional arrays for analytics
- ArrayList for non-generic storage
- Efficient data organization and retrieval

### 5. Badge System Implementation (1:45 - 2:15)
**Visual**: Show the badge earning system and all available badges
**Narration**:
> "Our comprehensive badge system demonstrates how we use data structures to track user achievements and provide gamification."

**Code Demonstration**:
```csharp
// Show badge calculation logic
private List<Badge> CalculateUserBadges(List<Issue> userIssues, UserSession session)
{
    var badges = new List<Badge>();
    
    // First Report Badge
    if (userIssues.Any())
    {
        badges.Add(new Badge
        {
            Id = 1,
            Name = "First Responder",
            ImagePath = "/images/first_responder.png",
            Type = BadgeType.FirstReport,
            IsEarned = true,
            PointsValue = 25
        });
    }
    
    // Water Saver Badge (3+ water supply issues)
    var waterIssues = userIssues.Where(i => i.Category == IssueCategory.WaterSupply).ToList();
    if (waterIssues.Count >= 3)
    {
        badges.Add(new Badge
        {
            Id = 7,
            Name = "Water Saver",
            ImagePath = "/images/water_saver.png",
            PointsValue = 60
        });
    }
}
```

**Live Demo**:
1. Show the badges page
2. Demonstrate earning different badges
3. Show the notification system for badge earning
4. Display all available badge images

**Code Demonstration**:
```csharp
// Show performance-optimized operations
public List<UserRanking> GetUserRankings()
{
    var rankings = new List<UserRanking>();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < _currentUserCount; i++)
    {
        var user = GetUserByIndex(i);
        if (user != null)
        {
            rankings.Add(new UserRanking
            {
                UserIndex = i,
                Username = user.Username,
                Points = user.TotalPoints,
                Level = user.Level
            });
        }
    }
    
    // Sort by points (descending) and assign ranks
    return rankings.OrderByDescending(r => r.Points).ToList();
}
```

**Key Points**:
- O(1) access time for user data
- Efficient sorting and ranking algorithms
- Memory-efficient data storage
